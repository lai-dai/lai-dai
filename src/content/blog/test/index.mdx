It's been a while since I've written about what we've been working on so I have a lot to share! Too much honestly — my main motivator for even getting this update out is that we've got even more stuff coming next week, and I feel like I'm not allowed to share that stuff until I share all of the stuff we've already shipped.

So put your swim suit on, sit back in your lounge chair, and prepare to soak up some vitamin CSS.

## Headless UI v1.6 is out

A few weeks ago we released a new minor version of <Link href="https://headlessui.dev/">Headless UI</Link>, the unstyled UI library we built to make it possible to add React and Vue support to Tailwind UI.

Check out <Link href="https://github.com/tailwindlabs/headlessui/releases/tag/%40headlessui%2Freact%40v1.6.0">the release notes</Link> for all of the details, but here are some of the highlights.

### Multiselect support

We've added a new `multiple` prop to both the `Combobox` and `Listbox` components so people can select more than one option.

Just add the `multiple` prop and bind an array as your `value` and you are ready to go:

```jsx {foo=bar}
function MyCombobox({ items }) {
  // [!code highlight:2]
  const [selectedItems, setSelectedItems] = useState([])

  return (
    // [!code highlight:9]
    <Combobox value={selectedItems} onChange={setSelectedItems} multiple>
      {selectedItems.length > 0 && (
        <ul>
          {selectedItems.map(item => (
            <li key={item}>{item}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      )}
      <Combobox.Input />
      <Combobox.Options>
        {items.map(item => (
          <Combobox.Option key={item} value={item}>
            {item}
          </Combobox.Option>
        ))}
      </Combobox.Options>
    </Combobox>
  )
}
```
